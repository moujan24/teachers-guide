 # Teachers Guide

## CSIT321 Major project

### Project Intro

Our vision is to provide the Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District (ISLHD) with a user-
friendly website and an application that includes the information pack, related to mental

health conditions and first aid of students in Schools, to be easily accessible to the key
stakeholders when needed.

### Project Objectives

1. To allow the teachers to view the information pack when needed
2. To allow the teachers to log in to their account to view information
3. To make it available online on a website
4. To make it available as an application that is compatible with both iOS and Android operating
systems
5. To be able to implement it in all NSW schools
6. To allow the client to log in to the system to make changes at anytime
7. To allow the client to make it visible to different types of stakeholders
